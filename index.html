  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I have always had an interest in solving puzzles and problem solving.</p>
  <p>I particularly like table top board games, Chess being my <strong>favorite!</strong></p>
  <p>I believe that coding lends itself to my interests and personality as an introverted person. However, the colloborative classroom environment is something I am quite keen to.</p>
  <h2>Education & Work Background</h2>
  <p>I went to the University of Oregon for a degree in political science and planning, public policy, and management (PPPM). There I got into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which I further pursued in a college certificate.</p>
  <p>I currently work at a remote sensing company that uses aerial acquired data to provide analytics to governments and private companies. It uses GIS extensively which touches on some programming languages including python</p>
  <p>I enjoy the map making component of GIS and even hosted some Mappy Hours (map making happy hours) pre-pandemic.</p>
