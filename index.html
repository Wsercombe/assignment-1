  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><p>I have always had an interest in solving puzzles and problem solving</p></li>
    <li><p>I particularly like table top board games, chess being my <strong>favorite!</strong></p></li>
    <li><p>I believe that coding lends itself to my interests and personality as an introverted person. However, the colloborative classroom environment is something I am quite keen to</p></li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Education & Work Background</h2>
  <ul>
  <li><p>I went to the University of Oregon for a degree in political science and planning, public policy, and management (PPPM). There I got into Geographic Information Systems (GIS), which I further pursued in a college certificate and eventually a job</p></li>
  <li><p>I currently work at a remote sensing company that uses aerial acquired data to provide analytics to governments and private companies. It uses GIS extensively which touches on some programming languages including python</p></li>
  <li><p>I enjoy the map making component of GIS and even hosted Mappy Hours (map making happy hours) pre-pandemic. I hope to develop some web mapping applications through the Epicodus program</p></li>
  </ul>
